4. **ngrok for Local Development:**
   - Download and install ngrok: [https://ngrok.com/](https://ngrok.com/)
   - Authenticate your ngrok account and start a tunnel to your local Flask app:
     ```bash
     ngrok http 5000  # Replace 5000 if your Flask app runs on a different port
     ``` 
   - Copy the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok ‚Äî you'll need this for your WhatsApp webhook.

5. **Configure the Project:**
   -  Fill in the required variables in your `.env` file, including your OpenAI credentials, WhatsApp Business API details, and the ngrok URL you obtained.

6. **Run the Application:**
   - Start your Flask application:
      ```bash
